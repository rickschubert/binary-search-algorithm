Attempting the binary search problem
===================================

This package represents my own take at the famous [binary search problem](http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/). The problem is: Given that we have a *sorted* list of integers, what is the fastest way to find the index of an particular element in that list? I.e. we have a list from 1 to 10 `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, how do we find the index of the number 4 (result should be `3`).

## Steps to run unit tests
- `go get`
- `go test`
